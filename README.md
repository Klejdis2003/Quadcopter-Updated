# Quadcopter-Updated
The code was developed to control the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi4 in order to control its GPIO pins to implement a tilt function for the camera,
open/close the claw used for material pickup and also the reel/unreel functionality(to drop or pull the claw where needed). In addition, I made use of the picamera
library to take pictures and record video with the pi camera.
The Raspberry Pi was mounted on a Quadcopter we built as part of the Nasa Quadcopter Challenge
